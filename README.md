PhotoTimeSync
=============

PhotoTimeSync is a small utility software that allows you to synchronize the date/time of photos taken by different cameras in only few seconds, without manual operation. 

The cameras don't have to be synchronize beforehand (which is very cumbersome, especially when you collect photos from friends cameras).

PhotoTimeSync is a .Net cross platform program: it will work both on Windows, Linux & Mac.
